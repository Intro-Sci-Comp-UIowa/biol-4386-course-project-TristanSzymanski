# Statement on Data Use

I am not permitted to make publicly available the GISAID data used for my research per the database's policies. GISAID provides a tool for compiling a table of all the sequences used,
their EPI_ISL identifiers, and the origin information of the individuals and labs which originally sequenced them. This table must be included in the final manuscript and will be generated
once the sequences being used in this article are confirmed.
