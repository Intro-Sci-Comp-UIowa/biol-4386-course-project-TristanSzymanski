# Statement on Data Use

I am not permitted to make publicly available the GISAID data used for my research per the database's policies. GISAID provides a tool for compiling a table of all the 
sequences used, their EPI_ISL identifiers, and the origin information of the individuals and labs which originally sequenced them. This table must be included in the 
final manuscript and will be generated once the sequences being used in this article are confirmed. I still have not figured out the best way to upload this table to
github due to its size. I am still experimenting with the best way to do so.
